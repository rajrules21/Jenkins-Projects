# Jenkins CI/CD Projects

Welcome to my Jenkins CI/CD Projects repository! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

In this repository, I am embarking on a series of Jenkins CI/CD projects aimed at strenthning my Jenkins and CICD skills and highlight my skills. Jenkins, an open-source automation server, serves as the backbone of our CI/CD pipelines, enabling us to automate builds, tests, and deployments with ease.

## Significance

Implementing CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins offers several benefits:
- **Automation:** Jenkins automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and human errors.
- **Continuous Integration:** By integrating code changes frequently, Jenkins helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Jenkins enables us to deploy code changes to production quickly and reliably.
- **Scalability:** Jenkins is highly flexible and scalable, allowing us to adapt to the evolving needs of our projects.

## Featured Projects

### [Project 1: Deploy a Python Flask Todo App Using CI/CD Pipeline in Jenkins to AWS EC2](https://github.com/rajrules21/Jenkins-Projects/tree/d292757834953dffe96509893e6475aeae4cd480/Project-1/)
